# Settlement Date Display Fix

## Issue
Settlement dates were showing as "N/A" in the Completed tab of all dashboards (Transporter, Tshogpa, Farmer) even when payment flow had valid timestamps indicating completed payment steps.

## Root Cause
The settlement date display logic in all dashboards was only checking legacy fields like `item.settlementDate` and `item.paymentConfirmedAt`, but not checking the `paymentFlow` array where the actual completion timestamps are stored when payment steps are confirmed.

## Solution Applied

### 1. TransporterDashboard Fix
- Enhanced `renderPaymentTableRow` function to check payment flow first
- Looks for `consumer_to_transporter` step completion timestamp
- Falls back to legacy settlement date fields if payment flow is not available

### 2. TshogpasDashboard Fix  
- Updated settlement date display to check for `transporter_to_tshogpa` or `consumer_to_tshogpa` step completion
- Falls back to legacy fields for backward compatibility

### 3. FarmerDashboard Fix
- Enhanced to check for farmer payment steps: `tshogpa_to_farmer`, `transporter_to_farmer`, or `consumer_to_farmer`
- Added `paymentCompletedAt` as additional fallback field

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
Each dashboard now uses this logic hierarchy for settlement dates:

1. **Check Payment Flow**: Look for the relevant payment step completion timestamp
2. **Check Legacy Settlement Date**: Use `item.settlementDate` if available  
3. **Check Payment Confirmed At**: Use `item.paymentConfirmedAt` if available
4. **Check Payment Completed At**: Use `item.paymentCompletedAt` if available (Farmer only)
5. **Fallback**: Show "N/A" if none available

### Code Pattern Used
```javascript
{(() => {
  // Get settlement date from payment flow first
  if (item.paymentFlow && item.paymentFlow.length > 0) {
    const relevantStep = item.paymentFlow.find(s => s.step === 'step_name');
    if (relevantStep && relevantStep.status === 'completed' && relevantStep.timestamp) {
      return new Date(relevantStep.timestamp).toLocaleDateString();
    }
  }
  
  // Fallback to legacy fields
  if (item.settlementDate) {
    return new Date(item.settlementDate).toLocaleDateString();
  }
  
  return 'N/A';
})()}
```

## Expected Result
- ✅ Settlement dates now show the actual completion timestamp from payment flow
- ✅ Completed payments display proper settlement dates instead of "N/A"
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with legacy settlement date fields
- ✅ All three dashboards (Transporter, Tshogpa, Farmer) now show consistent settlement dates

## Testing
1. Complete a payment workflow step using ✅ button
2. Switch to Completed tab
3. Verify settlement date shows the actual completion date/time
4. Verify this works across all three dashboard types

This fix ensures that users can see when payments were actually confirmed, providing proper audit trail visibility in the UI.
