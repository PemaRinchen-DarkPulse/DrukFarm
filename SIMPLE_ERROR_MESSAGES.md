## 📱 **NEW ERROR MESSAGES**

### **✅ When Tshogpa Tries to Mark Before Transporter:**
```json
{
  "error": "Payment failed. Please contact the transporter to confirm their payment first."
}
```

### **✅ When Seller Tries to Mark Before Higher Levels:**
```json
{
  "error": "Payment failed. Please contact the transporter to confirm their payment first."
}
```
**OR**
```json
{
  "error": "Payment failed. Please contact the tshogpa to confirm their payment first."
}
```

### **✅ Special Case (Tshogpa as Seller):**
```json
{
  "error": "Payment failed. Please contact the transporter to confirm their payment first."
}
```

## 🔄 **SMART CONTACT PERSON DETECTION**

The system automatically detects who the user should contact:

```javascript
// Smart detection logic
let contactPerson = 'the previous level';
if (previousStep.step.includes('transporter')) {
  contactPerson = 'the transporter';
} else if (previousStep.step.includes('tshogpa')) {
  contactPerson = 'the tshogpa';
}

error: `Payment failed. Please contact ${contactPerson} to confirm their payment first.`
```
