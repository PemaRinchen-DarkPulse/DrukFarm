# ✅ DISPATCHED FILTER WITH PENDING/COMPLETED TABS - IMPLEMENTED

## 🎯 **CHANGE SUMMARY**

**Requirement**: Add **Pending** and **Completed** tabs for the **Dispatched** filter in Tshogpa dashboard, similar to Earnings, while keeping everything else the same.

---

## 🔄 **CHANGES MADE**

### **✅ 1. Enabled Tabs for Dispatched Filter**
**Before**: Pending/Completed tabs were hidden when Dispatched filter was selected
```jsx
{/* Payment Tabs - Hide when Dispatched filter is selected */}
{paymentFilter !== "Dispatched" && (
  <View style={styles.paymentTabs}>
```

**After**: Pending/Completed tabs now show for both Earning and Dispatched filters
```jsx
{/* Payment Tabs - Show for both Earning and Dispatched filters */}
<View style={styles.paymentTabs}>
```

### **✅ 2. Updated Filtering Logic**
**Enhanced**: Applied Pending/Completed tab filtering to Dispatched orders as well
```jsx
// Enhanced filter by payment status (Pending vs Completed) - Apply to both Earning and Dispatched
if (paymentTab === "Pending") {
  // Show orders where payment is still pending
  const pendingFiltered = filtered.filter(order => {
    // ... same logic for both Earning and Dispatched
  });
  console.log(`${paymentFilter} - Pending payment filtered orders:`, pendingFiltered.length);
  return pendingFiltered;
} else if (paymentTab === "Completed") {
  // Show orders where payment has been received/completed
  const completedFiltered = filtered.filter(order => {
    // ... same logic for both Earning and Dispatched
  });
  console.log(`${paymentFilter} - Completed payment filtered orders:`, completedFiltered.length);
  return completedFiltered;
}
```

### **✅ 3. Added Action Buttons for Dispatched Pending**
**Enhanced**: Dispatched orders now show ✅ action buttons in Pending tab
```jsx
{isPending ? (
  <View style={[styles.paymentTableCell, { flex: 1.2, alignItems: 'flex-end', paddingRight: 8 }]}>
    <TouchableOpacity 
      style={styles.receivedButton}
      onPress={() => handleMarkPaymentReceived(item.orderId)}
    >
      <Icon name="check" size={16} color="#FFFFFF" />
    </TouchableOpacity>
  </View>
) : (
  <View style={[styles.paymentTableCell, { flex: 1.2 }]}>
    <Text style={[styles.paymentCellText, { /* status styling */ }]}>
      {item.status || 'Unknown'}
    </Text>
  </View>
)}
```

### **✅ 4. Updated Header for Dispatched**
**Enhanced**: Header shows "Action" for Pending tab, "Status" for Completed tab
```jsx
<Text style={styles.paymentHeaderText}>
  {isPending ? 'Action' : 'Status'}
</Text>
```
